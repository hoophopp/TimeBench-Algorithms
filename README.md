# TimeBench-Algorithms
A compact C project that benchmarks the execution time and timecomplexity behavior of key algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Linear Search, and Binary Search. The program measures microsecond-level performance on datasets of 10, 50, and 100 elements, providing a clear comparison between slow  and fast search techniques after re-sorting.
